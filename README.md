In this Project we developed a Stock Prediction System using the Linear Regression technique.
We also did many hypothesis tests to indentify the most useful columns in the data and to remove linearly dependent columns in order to boost code effeciency.
We also applied JL Lemma to reduce number of features or dimensions while preserving the data information.
